# Eventbrite Search Form

Created this because there was too much clicking to look for events in eventbrite and I want to view the events quickly. Still buggy.
Need to fix the following:

----
1. Fix the immediate async call as hitting the Eventbrite API call too frequently
2. Fix the async component call to both the datepicker and country dropdown
3. Link the date picker with the correct format to Eventbrite API
